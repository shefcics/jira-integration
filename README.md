# JIRA Integration

## Initial setup

This is the [JIRA version](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/linking-bitbucket-cloud-and-github-accounts-to-jira-software-300814271.html)
of the process, which is mercifully similar to the [GitHub version](https://help.github.com/articles/integrating-jira-with-your-projects/).
JIRA Version is slightly more up-to-date as regards items in the JIRA UI.
